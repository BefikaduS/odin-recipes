    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        Packets of ramen are actually super versatile because they simply don't taste like much on their own!  Ditch the spice packet that comes with the noodles.  When you use it, it kinda feels like eating salt water, because you basically are!  My Sesame Garlic Ramen Noodles are one of my favorite ramen "hacks" because I can still take a product that is super duper easy on my budget, impossibly quick to make, and turn it into something amazing!
